Composite Design Pattern
A strucural design pattern
Used when we want to make Objects which have a tree like structure
Composite Object - Objects composed of other Objects
Composite Design pattern will have internal Composite objects and leaf Objects(Do not have internal objects)
If an operation can be performed on the leaf node of compositely designed object
 then the same operation can be performed on the composite nodes as well
