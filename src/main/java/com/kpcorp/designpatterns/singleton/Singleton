Singleton

Allow to create only one instace of the class.
Steps to create a singleton class:
1. Create a static instance of the class
(It is static because the method in step 3 is atatic and its return type should be static)
2. Create a private constructor
3. Create a static method that returns the instance of the class(Step 1)

Drawback - Static instance gets created. Because of this the instance is always associated with the class 
and will take up memory
If the object is bulky = wastage of memory
This type of object creation = Eagerly instance creation
We can make it lazy -> We can create the instance only when the getInstance method gets called
