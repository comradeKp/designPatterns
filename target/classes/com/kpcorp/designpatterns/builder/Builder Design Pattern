Builder Design Pattern :
Creational design pattern

Suppose there is a phone class which has n number of fields
It can be set by setters or constructor
A toString method can be used to print the details
In the runner we call the constructor with n parameters and the print the object.
PAssing all parameters - Difficult( To know the sequense) and 
in some cases the user may not be able to send all the parameters or may be unaware of them

This is overcome by builder design pattern
There will be setters that returns the object after setting ech parameter step wise
The Builder class further has a getPhone method that returns the object of phone

At the client side you can create the object of builder
PhoneBuilder builder  = new PhoneBuilder();
builder.setSize(11);
builder.setBattery("B1"); -> There is no need to remember the sequence in whch the parameters are passed
Phone p = builder.getPhone()
System.out.println(p);

--------------------------------
Used when there are mnultiple parameters to be passed in the constructer 
and it is difficult to memorize the sequense
