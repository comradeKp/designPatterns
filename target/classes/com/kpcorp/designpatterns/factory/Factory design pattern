Factory Design Pattern:
The logic of object creation is hidden from the client.
The client makes the Object of the Factory class and passes parameters to it.
Based on the inputs and the logic inside the factory class the factory( get instance method)
creates the object of approprite class that implements the interface.
Hence the, getInstance() method of the class sorresponding to which the input is provided gets executed.


Even when new classes gets added, there wil be changes only in the factory provider class. There will not
be any hanges in the client side.
